Answer :

It is possible to have a method with same return type when it is overloaded. Compiler chooses the right method depending on the parameters used during method call.


Example:

Method 1 :
public int calc(int a, int b, int c){
return a+b+c;
}

Method 2 :
public int calc(int e, int f){
return e+f;


When the below method is called,The compiler will choose the Method1's implementation and returns the integer value,

calc(1,2,3);

Which proves that we can overload a method with the same return type.
